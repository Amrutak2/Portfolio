		<h3>About</h3>
        <p>I am a computer engineer who is passionate about building software solutions that create an impact. I 
           aim to build clean, simple, yet effective products that make lives easier. I am a focused individual with 
           keen interest in ML/AI and IOT. I enjoy solving business problems with data and algorithms. I understand 
           technology well and have strong technical skills. I have comprehensive exposure to various concepts and 
           have applied them vividly in different projects. In my undergraduate studies, I have taken on various 
           leadership roles including leading teams through projects. Currently, I am pursuing my master's degree 
           in computer science(Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) from Vellore Institute of Technology, 
           Vellore.

        <h5>BTECH</h5>
        <h5>1. Minor Project: Smart mirror using raspberry pi:</h5>
        <p>The goal of the smart mirror was to reduce time needed in a user’s daily routine and provide a merger 
            of user and technology that becomes an enhancement, not a new burden. The smart mirror did the thinking 
            for the user with intelligent, commonly used applications. Apps like their calendar, music, news, 
            Twitter, to-do lists, and weather will be available.

            2. Seminar 1 on Object Detection on Raspberry Pi and Book Reader using Raspberry pi for visually impaired
        </h5>
        
        <h5>3. Major Project: Website for government scheme for farmer:</h5>
        <p>The goal of this website is to provide
                a secured and transparent system which enable farmer to directly apply for a scheme and track 
                the status from time to time and know whether user is entitled to receive the fruit or the 
                application is rejected by officials.
        </p>

        <h5>MTECH</h5>
        <h5>1. Detection of Cyberbullying using Machine learning.</h5>
        <p>It is difficult to manually detect the cyberbullying cases. Whereas automatically detecting such incidents
            needs intelligent and autonomous systems. Machine learning can help in detecting the pattern bullies 
            mostly use, thus reducing the cyberbullying actions. Development of a machine learning (ML) approach 
            using various algorithms for the detection and prevention of cyberbullying is proposed.
